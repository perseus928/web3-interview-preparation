Finding a Web3 job that does not support remote work has become very rare. New challenges arose when companies switched to remote-first. Processes changed and there are new soft skills employers are looking for. This guide will prepare Web2 Devs switching to Web3, (bootcamp) graduates and self-taughts for their interviews.

## Why Should You Prepare

Congratulation! The company liked your application and invited you to a job interview. Most of the people put more effort into building a great professional resume and they don't put enough effort to get ready for an interview. Being prepared will increase your chances to land your dream job by 176% (I just made that number up). Here are some benefits of being prepared:

- increased confidence
- higher response quality
- avoid confusion, shyness, and panic
- get a better offer
- ask better and relevant questions at the end

## The Best Way To Learn

### Add Custom Answers

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/noahliechti/web3-interview-preparation/fork)
2. Clone your fork to your local environment
3. Create a feature branch `git checkout -b custom-answers`
4. Add custom answers for the behavioral interview and commit your changes `git commit -m 'add description here'`
5. Push your changes to your own repo with `git push -u origin custom-answers`.

If you want you can also add additional questions and answers for the other sections. If you think others could profit from your answers consider opening a pull request to the [main repo](https://github.com/noahliechti/web3-interview-preparation).

### Where To Learn (3 variants)

- Open your GitHub fork in the browser
- In your editor (maybe you need a markdown preview plugin)
- Make flashcards -> recommended!
  - I use Anki, because of its space-repetition feature -> Anki deck coming soon

### Process

1. Read question
2. Answer question **out loud**
3. Reveal answer and check it
4. Rate how good your answer was (optional -> only applicable with flashcards)

## How To Contribute

- Is there a question you would like to add because other people could benefit from it? We would love to see it
- Do you think a question is unnecessary? Remove it and add a justification
- There is a typo or an incorrect answer? Your correction is welcome
- There is a question you would like to highlight, because it seems to pop up on many interviews?

If you would like to contribute please make an issue first. Other members will be able to vote on your proposal for one week. The number of upvotes have to be at minimum 4x the number of downvotes. If your improvement gets accepted you can now make a pull request.

## Technical Interview

### Previous Experiences

Employers like to ask questions related to your application. So go over your resume and and think about 5 to 10 followup questions a potential employer could ask. Being prepared for such question shows that you know what you were doing. Be ready to answer a bit more technical questions related to your recent experiences. Some examples:

<details>
  <summary>Why did you choose to use [technology x] in your project? What were the advantages over similar packages?</summary>
    <!-- <ul>

### Web3 Questions (& Answers)

#### Basics

<details>
  <summary>What is Web1?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Web1 was the first phase of the internet. Most participants were consumers
        of content. It was all about serving static content instead of dynamic HTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is Web2?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can think of Web2 as the interactive and social web.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is Web3?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'd call it the decentralized internet. It provides native built-in payments while still being self-governing
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is consensus?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consensus is the agreement on what (usually transactions) has happened and what has not
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is decentralization?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Decentralisation is the opposite of centralisation and means that something like power, control or trust is not focused on just a few people, but is distributed among many or even all of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a decentralized ledger?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I would describe it as a database that gets saved from a group of people and is updated in regular blocks of time
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DAO is an acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization
      </li>
      <li>
        It is an organization that’s governed by code instead of leaders
      </li>
      <li>
        A DAO in its simplest form can be described as a group chat with a shared bank account
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between an NFT and a fungible token?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        NFTs are unique digital asset like artworks and collectibles. Non fungible tokens are not interchangeable
      </li>
      <li>
        Fungible tokens like Ether or Bitcoin on the other hand are divisible and replaceable
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between a coin an a token?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes people use the term "coin" and "token" interchangeably. However, there are very big differences between crypto coins and crypto tokens
      </li>
      <li>
        A digital coin is an asset that is native to its own blockchain. (BTC, ETH, ...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Tokens are created on existing blockchains (all ERC-20 tokens, ...)
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between layer 1 and layer 2 networks?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A layer 1 network describes the underlying "main" blockchain that is the ultimate source of truth and is responsible for the settlement of transactions
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 2 networks extend the functionality of their layer 1 counterpart. For example they increase the transaction speed or lower transaction costs. A layer 2 solution is not a blockchain! (e.g Arbitrum for Ethereum)
      </li>
      <li>
        Hint: Layer 1 solutions without scaling limitations usually don't need scaling solutions
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a side chain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A side chain is essentially just a blockchain that is linked to another main blockchain. (e.g Liquid Network for Bitcoin, Polygon for Ethereum)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        DeFi is an acronym for decentralized finance
      </li>
      <li>
        It is an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services
      </li>
      <li>
        Typical services include earning interest, borrowing and lending crypto
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a crypto wallet?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets store your private key and let you send and receive cryptocurrencies using a beautiful UI
      </li>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto! If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money and not the money itself
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Bring the terms "decentralization", "bitcoin", "crypto currency", "consensus" and "blockchain" in an order. (broad to specific)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consensus -> decentralization -> blockchain -> crypto currency -> bitcoin
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>

      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Blockchain And Blockchain Alternatives

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A blockchain is a digital file consisting of records. The number of records is growing in regular blocks of time. All records are linked together using cryptography
      </li>
      <li>
        For a blockchain to be decentralised it has to be distributed to a group of people
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are blockchains resistant to modification of their data?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Tell me the three factors of the blockchain trilemma?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Explain a blockchain alternative</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Transactions in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) are linked to one and another directly instead of being grouped and processed in blocks. This makes DAGs more scalable than blockchains in theory
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can you “hide” a transaction on a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transaction can't be hidden. All transactions are public
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where are transactions stored in a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a blockchain, a transaction is stored in a "block"
      </li>
      <li>
        This blocks are saved on nodes that are part of the network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a miner?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>

    </ul>
</details>

#### Cryptography

<details>
  <summary>What is a merkle root?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       The merkle root is the root hash of a merkle tree
      </li>
      <li>
       The merkle root is put into the block header of a block
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What role do transactions hashes play in a merkle tree?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a merkle tree, the the transaction hashes are considered the leaves. Each non-leaf node (branch) is a hash of its child hashes
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are merkle trees so important in BTC?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If Bitcoin didn’t have merkle trees, every node on the network would need to maintain a full copy of every transaction that has ever happened in Bitcoin
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Work work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoW consensus is to solve a complex mathematical problem. The first miner to find the right solution, advertise it to the whole network, and receive a reward in cryptocurrency provided by the protocol
      </li>
      <li>
        The disadvantage is that it requires a lot of computational power
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Stake work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism
      </li>
      <li>
        Proof of Stake tries to deal with the main drawback of PoW
      </li>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoS consensus is that cryptocurrency owners can stake their crypto. From this so called "validators" one then is selected randomly to "mint" a new block. The more coins a person stakes, the higher is the chance to be selected
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a proof of work nonce?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A nonce plays a crucial part in the mining process with PoW. The nonce is the missing piece of the puzzle needed to discover the next block
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What does "nonce" mean?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "nonce" stands for "Number User Only Once"
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a hard fork?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hard forks are protocol changes which aren't compatible with the older version of the cryptocurrency. The chain splits into two and the participants can choose to operate in any version
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately after a blockchain forks, the two resulting chains share the exact same transaction history
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a soft fork?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In contrast to a hard fork, soft forks are backward compatible. They don’t have a significant impact on the change of protocol and participants can operate within the network without upgrading their software
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Attacks

<details>
  <summary>What is a 51% attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a hacker is able to control 51% or more of the nodes, he will gain control over the entire network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a replay attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A replay attack is taking a transaction on one blockchain, and maliciously or fraudulently repeating it on another blockchain. Two post-fork blockchains are vulnerable for this type of attack
      </li>
      <li>
        For a replay attack to work the two chains need to share a common history
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How can a blockchain prevent replay attacks?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To prevent replay attacks, the developers on one of the two post-fork blockchains can make a slight change to transaction rules
      </li>
      <li>
        Ethereum prevents same-chain replay attacks by having a transaction counter in each account. This nonce also prevents double spending
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
