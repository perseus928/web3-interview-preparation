Finding a Web3 job that does not support remote work has become very rare. New challenges arose when companies switched to remote-first. Processes changed and there are new soft skills employers are looking for. This guide will prepare Web2 Devs switching to Web3, (bootcamp) graduates and self-thoughts for their interviews.

## Who Is This For

- **Job Seeker**: Did you just land a Web3 interview? This repo will help you prepare
- **Recruiter**: Are you a recruiter? Get inspired by our interview questions
- **Curious People**: You just want to test your blockchain knowledge? Use this repo as a quiz

## Why Should You Prepare

Most people put more effort into building a great professional resume and they don't put enough effort to get ready for an interview. Being prepared will increase your chances to land your dream job by 176% (I just made that number up). Here are some benefits of being prepared:

- increased confidence
- higher response quality
- avoid confusion, shyness, and panic
- get a better offer
- ask better and relevant questions at the end

## The Best Way To Learn

### Add Custom Answers

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/noahliechti/web3-interview-preparation/fork)
2. Clone your fork to your local environment
3. Create a feature branch `git checkout -b custom-answers`
4. Add custom answers for the behavioral interview and commit your changes `git commit -m 'add description here'`
5. Push your changes to your own repo with `git push -u origin custom-answers`

If you want you can also add additional questions and answers for the other sections. If you think others could profit from your answers consider opening a pull request to the [main repo](https://github.com/noahliechti/web3-interview-preparation).

### Use The Right Tools (3 variants)

- **Make flashcards (recommended!)**
  - I use Anki, because of its space-repetition feature
  - Checkout my [Anki Card Templates](https://gist.github.com/noahliechti/d05444c0b4a8b0f25c44dd3c05e718d7)
- Open your GitHub fork in the browser
- In your editor (maybe you need a markdown preview plugin)

### Process

1. Read question
2. Answer the question **out loud**
3. Reveal the answer and check it
4. Rate how good your answer was (optional -> only applicable with flashcards)

## Get Invited For An Interview

There are a lot of great resources on how to get invited for an interview. Here is my Web3 approach (worked every time so far):

1. Find the GitHub account of the organization you are applying for
2. Submit an issue or pull request that adds value
3. Get in contact with employees on the company's discord channel
   1. Ask them about their experience working for the company
   2. Mention your contribution and interest for the open position XYZ
   3. Politely ask them to forward your resume to the person in charge

## Before The Interview

- Do several mock interviews with a friend (remote)
- Clean up the projects you mentioned in your resume (employers will probably look at it, so add comments and a readme)
- Join a DAO (shows that you are sociable person and interested in the space)

## At The Interview

- Use a quiet space that has a clean background and a good internet connection
- Make sure your webcam is on you eye level (place the laptop on a stack of books)
- Use a headset
- Be on time

## Behavioral Interview Questions

## Technical Interview Questions

### Previous Experience Interview Questions

Employers like to ask questions related to your application. So go over your resume and think about 5 to 10 followup questions a potential employer could ask. Being prepared for such a question shows that you know what you were doing. Be ready to answer a bit more technical questions related to your recent experiences. Some examples:

<details>
  <summary>Why did you choose to use [technology x] in your project? What were the advantages over similar packages?</summary>
    <!-- <ul>
      <li>
        add answer here

      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a decentralized ledger?</summary>

      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between a coin an a token?</summary>

      </li>
      <li>
        A digital coin is an asset that is native to its own blockchain. (BTC, ETH, ...)
      </li>

        Layer 2 networks extend the functionality of their layer 1 counterpart. For example they increase the transaction speed or lower transaction costs. A layer 2 solution is not a blockchain! (e.g Arbitrum for Ethereum)
      </li>
      <li>
        Hint: Layer 1 solutions without scaling limitations usually don't need scaling solutions
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a side chain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A side chain is essentially just a blockchain that is linked to another main blockchain. (e.g Liquid Network for Bitcoin, Polygon for Ethereum)

  <summary>What is a crypto wallet?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets store your private key and let you send and receive cryptocurrencies using a beautiful UI
      </li>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto! If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money and not the money itself
      </li>
    </ul>

      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Blockchain And Blockchain Alternatives

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A blockchain is a digital file consisting of records. The number of records is growing in regular blocks of time. All records are linked together using cryptography
      </li>
      <li>
        For a blockchain to be decentralised it has to be distributed to a group of people
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are blockchains resistant to modification of their data?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Tell me the three factors of the blockchain trilemma?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        security, decentralization, and scalability -> you can only choose two!
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What problem does a blockchain solve?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How can I save a digital information in a immutable way without a centralised authority
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Explain a blockchain alternative</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Transactions in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) are linked to one and another directly instead of being grouped and processed in blocks. This makes DAGs more scalable than blockchains in theory
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can you “hide” a transaction on a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transaction can't be hidden. All transactions are public
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where are transactions stored in a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a blockchain, a transaction is stored in a "block"
      </li>
      <li>
        This blocks are saved on nodes that are part of the network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a miner?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Miners are nodes, who receive rewards for verifying transactions and marinating network integrity
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a hard fork?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hard forks are protocol changes which aren't compatible with the older version of the cryptocurrency. The chain splits into two and the participants can choose to operate in any version
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately after a blockchain forks, the two resulting chains share the exact same transaction history
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a soft fork?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In contrast to a hard fork, soft forks are backward compatible. They don’t have a significant impact on the change of protocol and participants can operate within the network without upgrading their software
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Work work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoW consensus is to solve a complex mathematical problem. The first miner to find the right solution, advertise it to the whole network, and receive a reward in cryptocurrency provided by the protocol
      </li>
      <li>
        The disadvantage is that it requires a lot of computational power
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Stake work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism
      </li>
      <li>
        Proof of Stake tries to deal with the main drawback of PoW
      </li>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoS consensus is that cryptocurrency owners can stake their crypto. From this so called "validators" one then is selected randomly to "mint" a new block. The more coins a person stakes, the higher is the chance to be selected
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a proof of work nonce?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A nonce plays a crucial part in the mining process with PoW. The nonce is the missing piece of the puzzle needed to discover the next block
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What does "nonce" mean?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "nonce" stands for "Number User Only Once"
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Cryptography

<details>
  <summary>What is a hash collision?</summary>
    <ul>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is symmetric key encryption?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Symmetric key encryption is also called private key cryptography and uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is asymmetric key encryption?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Symmetric key encryption is also called public key cryptography and uses two separate keys to encrypt and decrypt messages
      </li>
      <li>
       First a private key is randomly generated. With the use of a mathematical formula the public key can be created from the private key. The public key can be shared with everyone, whereas the private key must be kept secret
      </li>
      <li>
        Data is encrypted using any one of the keys and decrypted with the other. Unlike with symmetric encryption only the encrypted data (but not the key itself) has to be transferred, making it more secure against man-in-the-middle attacks
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a merkle tree?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       A merkle tree is a data structure used to efficiently summarize and validate large data sets
      </li>
      <li>
       A merkle tree consists of the merkle root, which is the root hash. The merkle root is then put into the block header of a block
      </li>
      <li>
        In a merkle tree, the the transaction hashes are considered the leaves. Each non-leaf node (branch) is a hash of its child hashes
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are merkle trees so important in BTC?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If Bitcoin didn’t have merkle trees, every node on the network would need to maintain a full copy of every transaction that has ever happened in Bitcoin
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Explain the term "zero knowledge proof"</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a cryptographic method that allows one party to prove the knowledge of certain information to the other party without revealing the data in question
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Attacks

<details>
  <summary>What is a 51% attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a hacker is able to control 51% or more of the nodes, he will gain control over the entire network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a reentrancy attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A reentrancy attack occurs when a function makes an external call to an untrusted contract. The untrusted contract then makes a recursive call back to the original function in an attempt to drain funds
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Name two ways reentrancy attacks can be prevented</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implementing the checks-effects-interactions pattern (update the state before making external calls)
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a reentrancy guard (e.g modifier by OpenZeppelin)
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a replay attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A replay attack is taking a transaction on one blockchain, and maliciously or fraudulently repeating it on another blockchain. Two post-fork blockchains are vulnerable for this type of attack
      </li>
      <li>
        For a replay attack to work the two chains need to share a common history
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How can a blockchain prevent replay attacks?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To prevent replay attacks, the developers on one of the two post-fork blockchains can make a slight change to transaction rules
      </li>
      <li>
        Ethereum prevents same-chain replay attacks by having a transaction counter in each account. This nonce also prevents double spending
      </li>
    </ul>
