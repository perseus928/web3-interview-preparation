## Why should you prepare

## The best way to learn

### Add custom answers

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/noahliechti/web3-interview-preparation/fork)
2. Clone your fork to your local environment
3. You can now add custom answers for the behavioral interview and push your changes to your own repo. If you want you can also add additional questions and answers for the other sections

### Where to learn (3 variants)

- Open your GitHub fork in the browser
- In your editor (maybe you need a markdown preview plugin)
- Make flashcards -> recommended!
  - I use Anki, because of its space-repetition feature -> Anki deck coming soon

### Process

1. Read question
2. Answer question **out loud**
3. Reveal answer and check it
4. Rate how good your answer was (optional -> only applicable with flashcards)

## Technical Interview

### Previous Experiences

Employers like to ask questions related to your application. So go over your resume and and think about 5 to 10 followup questions a potential employer could ask. Being prepared for such question shows that you know what you were doing. Be ready to answer a bit more technical questions related to your recent experiences. Some examples:

<details>
  <summary>Why did you choose to use [technology x] in your project? What were the advantages over similar packages?</summary>
    <!-- <ul>
      <li>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>What was the biggest challenge you faced at [job x / project y]?</summary>
    Similar question: What's a tough problem you've solved?
    Tipp: Focus on how the challenge was solved, not the challenge itself

### Web3 Questions (& Answers)

#### Basics

<details>
  <summary>What is Web1?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Web1 was the first phase of the internet. Most participants were consumers
        of content. It was all about serving static content instead of dynamic HTML.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is Web2?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can think of Web2 as the interactive and social web.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is Web3?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'd call it the decentralized internet. It provides native built-in payments while still being self-governing
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is consensus?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consensus is the agreement on what (usually transactions) has happened and what has not
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is decentralization?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Decentralisation is the opposite of centralisation and means that something like power, control or trust is not focused on just a few people, but is distributed among many or even all of them.
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a decentralized ledger?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I would describe it as a database that gets saved from a group of people and is updated in regular blocks of time
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a DAO?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DAO is an acronym for Decentralized Autonomous Organization
      </li>
      <li>
        It is an organization that’s governed by code instead of leaders
      </li>
      <li>
        A DAO in its simplest form can be described as a group chat with a shared bank account
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between an NFT and a fungible token?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        NFTs are unique digital asset like artworks and collectibles. Non fungible tokens are not interchangeable
      </li>
      <li>
        Fungible tokens like Ether or Bitcoin on the other hand are divisible and replaceable
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between a coin an a token?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sometimes people use the term "coin" and "token" interchangeably. However, there are very big differences between crypto coins and crypto tokens
      </li>
      <li>
        A digital coin is an asset that is native to its own blockchain. (BTC, ETH, ...)
      </li>
      <li>
        Tokens are created on existing blockchains (all ERC-20 tokens, ...)
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is the difference between layer 1 and layer 2 networks?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A layer 1 network describes the underlying "main" blockchain that is the ultimate source of truth and is responsible for the settlement of transactions
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 2 networks extend the functionality of their layer 1 counterpart. For example they increase the transaction speed or lower transaction costs. A layer 2 solution is not a blockchain! (e.g Arbitrum for Ethereum)
      </li>
      <li>
        Hint: Layer 1 solutions without scaling limitations usually don't need scaling solutions
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a side chain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A side chain is essentially just a blockchain that is linked to another main blockchain. (e.g Liquid Network for Bitcoin, Polygon for Ethereum)
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is DeFi?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        DeFi is an acronym for decentralized finance
      </li>
      <li>
        It is an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services
      </li>
      <li>
        Typical services include earning interest, borrowing and lending crypto
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a crypto wallet?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets store your private key and let you send and receive cryptocurrencies using a beautiful UI
      </li>
      <li>
        Crypto wallets technically don’t store your crypto! If you lose your private keys, you lose access to your money and not the money itself
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Bring the terms "decentralization", "bitcoin", "crypto currency", "consensus" and "blockchain" in an order. (broad to specific)</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Consensus -> decentralization -> blockchain -> crypto currency -> bitcoin
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What are dApps?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications that have their backend code (smart contracts) running on a decentralized network and not a centralized server
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Blockchain and Blockchain alternatives

<details>
  <summary>What is a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A blockchain is a digital file consisting of records. The number of records is growing in regular blocks of time. All records are linked together using cryptography
      </li>
      <li>
        For a blockchain to be decentralised it has to be distributed to a group of people
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are blockchains resistant to modification of their data?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Tell me the three factors of the blockchain trilemma?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        security, decentralization, and scalability -> you can only choose two!
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What problem does a blockchain solve?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        How can I save a digital information in a immutable way without a centralised authority
      </li>
    </ul>

  <summary>Explain a blockchain alternative</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Transactions in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) are linked to one and another directly instead of being grouped and processed in blocks. This makes DAGs more scalable than blockchains in theory
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Can you “hide” a transaction on a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Transaction can't be hidden. All transactions are public
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Where are transactions stored in a blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a blockchain, a transaction is stored in a "block"
      </li>
      <li>
        This blocks are saved on nodes that are part of the network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What is a miner?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       Miners are nodes, who receive rewards for verifying transactions and marinating network integrity
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Cryptography

<details>
  <summary>What is a merkle root?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
       The merkle root is the root hash of a merkle tree
      </li>
      <li>
       The merkle root is put into the block header of a block
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>What role do transactions hashes play in a merkle tree?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        In a merkle tree, the the transaction hashes are considered the leaves. Each non-leaf node (branch) is a hash of its child hashes
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why are merkle trees so important in BTC?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If Bitcoin didn’t have merkle trees, every node on the network would need to maintain a full copy of every transaction that has ever happened in Bitcoin
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

#### Attacks

<details>
  <summary>What is a 51% attack?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a hacker is able to control 51% or more of the nodes, he will gain control over the entire network
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>Which consensus mechanism does Ethereum use?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>

<details>
  <summary>Which programming language is used to write smart contracts?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Solidity is the primary programming language used for writing smart contracts and dApps
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Work work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoW consensus is to solve a complex mathematical problem. The first miner to find the right solution, advertise it to the whole network, and receive a reward in cryptocurrency provided by the protocol
      </li>
      <li>
        The disadvantage is that it requires a lot of computational power
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>How does Proof of Stake work?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It is a cryptocurrency consensus mechanism
      </li>
      <li>
        Proof of Stake tries to deal with the main drawback of PoW
      </li>
      <li>
        The central principle behind PoS consensus is that cryptocurrency owners can stake their crypto. From this so called "validators" one then is selected randomly to "mint" a new block. The more coins a person stakes, the higher is the chance to be selected
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

    <ul>
      <li>
        ABI is an acronym for Application Binary Interface
      </li>
      <li>
        The ABI is the interface to interact with our smart contract
      </li>
      <li>
        The ABI can be generated from your smart contract source code (you have to compile it)
      </li>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>How are smart contracts stored into the blockchain?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
</details>

##### Solidity

<details>
  <summary>Why should a developer define a solidity version at the beginning of a file?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It reduces incompatibility glitches that can occur while compiling with another version
      </li>
    </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Why do smart contracts written in Solidity or Viper need to be compiled?</summary>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The EVM doesn't understand these high-level languages. Therefor the source code has to be translated into machine language (bytecode) that the EVM is able to execute
      </li>
    </ul>
